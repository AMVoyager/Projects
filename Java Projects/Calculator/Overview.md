# Simple Calculator in Java using Swing

This Java file is a simple calculator application built using the Java Swing library. It provides basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

The calculator includes the following features:

1. **User-Friendly GUI**: The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

2. **Numeric Buttons**: It has buttons for digits 0-9 to input numbers.

3. **Arithmetic Operation Buttons**: Buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) are available for performing mathematical operations.

4. **Clear and Equals Buttons**: The "C" button allows the user to clear the input, and the "=" button computes the result of the operation.

5. **Display Area**: A text field is used to display the input and the result of the calculations.

6. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

7. **Error Handling**: It includes error handling to prevent division by zero or invalid input.

## Code Overview

The Java code consists of the following main components:

- **Main Class**: The main class initializes the Swing components and sets up the GUI layout.

- **Action Listeners**: Action listeners are attached to the numeric and operation buttons to respond to user interactions.

- **Math Operations**: Methods for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented.

- **User Input Handling**: The code handles user input and updates the display area accordingly.

- **Error Handling**: Error handling is implemented to handle invalid input and division by zero.

- **Layout and Design**: The layout of the GUI is configured, specifying the positions of buttons and the display area.

## How to Run

To run the calculator, compile the Java file and execute the resulting class file. The calculator GUI will open, allowing users to perform calculations.

## Usage

1. Click the numeric buttons to input numbers.

2. Click the arithmetic operation buttons to select the operation.

3. Click the "=" button to compute the result.

4. Use the "C" button to clear the input.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies other than Java.

## Future Improvements

Possible improvements for this calculator could include:

- Adding support for more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Implementing memory functions (e.g., memory store, recall, and clear).
- Enhancing the user interface with additional features like a history log or scientific calculator functions.
